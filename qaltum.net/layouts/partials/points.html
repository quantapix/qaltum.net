        Faux Precision Distracts From Cruel Intent
      </h2>

        Overwhelming fake "legal precision" of extensive volumes of static text

        Critical to successful lawsuits is "seeing through" the deliberate,
        QAnon-style abusive emotional confusion and then quickly prioritizing
        the essential narratives.
